# Jordanian ALPR
The objective of this project is to create a system that employs object detection and character recognition techniques to detect and recognize license plates from images.

# Introduction
As the number of cars in Jordan keeps going up, it becomes increasingly difficult to manually control and improve traffic congestion, public security, law enforcement, and vehicle identification in the country. In order to address these challenges, it becomes necessary to leverage the power of artificial intelligence, such as using deep learning algorithms to build and develop a robust, real-time automatic license plate recognition (ALPR) system. This system can process input images of various sizes and lighting conditions, accurately identify vehicle license plates, and convert the recognized license plate numbers into digital text. Moreover, it will help to improve traffic management and enhance public security as it can be used to track vehicles for public security purposes, such as identifying suspicious vehicles involved in criminal activity. Furthermore, it can improve law enforcement, by monitoring and enforcing speed limits, and providing faster and more accurate vehicle identification.
